In the context of hyperbolic networks, the presence of hierarchy is usually understood broadly, as a general consequence of the presence of some sort of heterogeneity of the network nodes, which implies the possibility for classifying the nodes into groups (classes or categories) that are interconnected through a containment hierarchy [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.82.036106], or yields a natural ranking of the network nodes where the status of each node is determined by the given heterogeneous topological property [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.033519] (e.g. the node degree, which can be treated as a simple measure of importance, and thus, as a proxy for a node's status in the hierarchy of importance [https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.92.178702]). Therefore, the general expectation is simply that the hyperbolic space is a good and natural candidate for hosting a network if it has a heterogeneous (scale-free) degree distribution, and graphs that are strongly hierarchical in a more traditional sense (describing e.g. dominance relationships) are not necessarily expected to fit outstandingly well in the hyperbolic space.
